# vietnam_war
Tile-formatted version of the THOR dataset for Vietnam

These are taken from CSVs generated by the US military and shared somewhere--like `data.mil` or something?--that was up in the Obama admin and then down in the Trump admin.

They contain selected data about flight missions in the Vietnam war by American-allied forces.
